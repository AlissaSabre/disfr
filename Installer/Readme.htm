<h1>disfr</h1>
<p>A Windows program to view/examine XLIFF and other bilingual contents.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/xliff-core/xliff-core.html">XLIFF</a> is an OASIS standard XML file format for bilingual documents.
It is used in most (if not all) of modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_translation">CAT</a> environments.</p>
<p>disfr is a handy tool to show the contents of XLIFF and similar/related bilingual files.
It has some features to further examine the files,
e.g., filtering and sorting segments, inspecting tags,
or showing non-translatable portion of the source document.
Moreover, it may allow you comparing differences between versions in the future.
It has no way to edit/change the contents, however.</p>
<p>disfr is a Windows .NET Framework program written in C# using WPF.
(And, no, it does not strictly adhere the MVVM doctrine...  In fact, it heavily uses <em>code behinds</em>.  This note is for programmers.)</p>
<p>For the moment, disfr is under development.
You can consider it is in a sort of an alpha stage.
Ready-to-run Windows Installer (*.msi) files are available on the <a href="https://github.com/AlissaSabre/disfr/releases">Releases</a> page.
If you are a programmer, you should also be able to build the source files on HEAD of master branch always.</p>
<h2>File formats</h2>
<p>It supports reading of the following file formats, which are more or less based on XLIFF standard:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard XLIFF 1.2 files (*.xlf, *.xliff.)</li>
<li>Zipped XLIFF 1.1 and 1.2 files.</li>
<li>SDL Idiom WorldServer translation kit and return packages (*.xlz, *.wsxz.)</li>
<li>SDL Trados Studio files (*.sdlxliff.)</li>
<li>memoQ bilingual files (*.mqxlz, *.mqxliff.)</li>
<li>Wordfast (WFA/WFP5) files (*.txlf.)</li>
<li>Any other XLIFF 1.2 based bilingual files (by ignoring some unknown portions of contents.)</li>
</ul>
<p>It can also read the following related file formats, which are not based on XLIFF:</p>
<ul>
<li>TMX translation memory exchange files (*.tmx.)</li>
<li>SDL Trados Studio Translation Memories (*.sdltm.)</li>
<li>Common bilingual glossaries on Microsoft Excel file (*.xls, *.xlsx)</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be capable of reading the following file formats in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard XLIFF 2.0 and packages containing it.</li>
<li>.po files for GNU gettext.</li>
<li>.string files for iOS Apps.</li>
<li>Common glossaries on so-called CSV files.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can also <em>write</em> portions of contents out to the following file formats (without editing):</p>
<ul>
<li>TMX files.</li>
<li>Microsoft Excel (.xlsx) files.</li>
<li>A simple bilingual table in HTML5 (similar to <em>external review</em> files produced by CAT tools).</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be capable of <em>writing</em> the contents out to the following file formats in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>So-called CSV.</li>
<li>Office OpenXML WordProcessing document (aka .docx) as a so-called bilingual table.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other features</h2>
<p>Major features of disfr (other than supported file formats) are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lightweight</strong>: disfr usually starts up and reads a file faster than ordinary CAT tools.</li>
<li><strong>Simple table view</strong>: disfr shows everything in a simple two-dimensional table format with no frills.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed metadata</strong>: XLIFF or other bilingual files contain rich segment metadata, though large parts of them are consumed by CAT tools themselves and not exposed to users.  disfr presents a lot more of those metadata to users for handy inspection.</li>
<li><strong>Filter as you type</strong>: disfr supports filtering of segments by its unique <em>filter as you type</em> UI.</li>
<li><strong>Extensibility</strong>: disfr has a simple <em>plugin</em> mechanism so that you can add support for more file formats easily.  In particular, supports for sdltm and Excel files are implemented as respective plugins (though we have no API/SPI document for plugin authors yet).</li>
</ul>
