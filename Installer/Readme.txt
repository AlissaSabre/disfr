The solution folder "Installer" contains files used by disfr
installer.

Because I'm using Visual Studio Express and Microsoft doesn't allow
its users to use any third party add-in, I can't use WiX toolset in
Visual Studio environment.  That's why the folder and MS-DOS batch
files are.

You need to run build.bat from a command prompt window to produce an
msi file for disfr.
